# Unity_Data_Editor
 
This project presents a Unity editor window designed for a space war/adventure game. 

The editor allows users to create, edit, and delete the following game objects: 
- Space ships
- Officers
- Planetary Systems
- Missions

There are some relationships between the objects, so related objects can automatically update when changes to one object are made. 

The editor supports data storage and retrieval from the following:
- JSON file
- SQLite DB
- MongoDB
